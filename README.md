# CaliforniaCOVID
 As the Coronavirus continues to spread it has become ever more apparent that we are dealing with the biggest public health challenge of our generation. Fortunately, Californiaâ€™s state and county officials have been working tirelessly for months to help protect and ensure the safety of all citizens. Thus, the purpose of this project is to utilize my data wrangling, visualization, and analytical skills to obtain some insight on the spread of the coronavirus in California and learn about the challenges that our government experts are facing while making these tough decisions. In this report, I will not only share my results but also go in-depth into the decisions taken to come to my conclusions. 
This analysis is divided into three parts: 
1.	Overview of the Spread of COVID-19 in California 
2.	Analysis of some Factors that could explain the differences in spread among counties
3.	Analysis of Testing Access, and ICU availability across California.
